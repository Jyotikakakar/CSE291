## Transcript 12: LONG - Thursday 3:00 PM

**Characters:** Jack, John, Rebecca  
**Context:** References performance report completion, discusses next week's strategy.

**Rebecca:** Jack, John, great work on getting the quarterly performance report done so quickly. I got it this morning.
**Jack:** Thanks, Rebecca. John really drove that. He and Jill knocked it out.
**John:** It came together well. Hey Rebecca, now that the performance report is done, I wanted to talk about next steps.
**Rebecca:** What did you have in mind?
**John:** Well, I mentioned to Jill on Tuesday that we should create a comprehensive market report. She said we could start next week. I think that should be our priority for the next cycle.
**Rebecca:** A market report? Tell me more.
**John:** It would show our market positioning, competitive analysis—the stuff we just compiled—and give us strategic recommendations. More actionable than just the internal performance numbers.
**Rebecca:** I like that. How long would it take?
**Jack:** I'd say two to three weeks if we want to do it right. John and I could lead it, with support from Marcus and Tom on the competitive analysis side.
**Rebecca:** Okay, let's add it to the roadmap. Start next week, plan for completion in three weeks.
**John:** Perfect. I'll document the scope and we'll kick off Monday.

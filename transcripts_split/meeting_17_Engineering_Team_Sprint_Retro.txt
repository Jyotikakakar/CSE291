TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Tyler: Let's reflect on the last sprint. What went well?

Amy: I thought the communication was much better this time. The daily standups were actually useful.

Tyler: Good to hear. What made them more effective?

Amy: People came prepared and kept their updates concise.

Derek: I also think the pair programming sessions helped. We solved that authentication bug way faster working together.

Tyler: Great. Let's make sure we continue those practices. What didn't go well?

Amy: The requirements for the dashboard feature changed midway through the sprint. That threw us off.

Derek: Yeah, we had to redo a bunch of work.

Tyler: That's frustrating. How can we prevent that?

Amy: I think we need better upfront requirements gathering. Maybe involve engineering earlier in the planning process.

Tyler: That makes sense. Derek, what else could we improve?

Derek: Testing took longer than expected. We need to write more unit tests as we code, not after.

Amy: Agreed. We should make that a standard practice.

Tyler: Okay, so our commitments for next sprint: continue pair programming, involve engineering in early planning, and write tests as we develop.

Amy: Should we also set up a requirements review session before each sprint starts?

Tyler: Good idea. I'll schedule a standing meeting for that.

Derek: One more thing - can we get better tooling for our deployment process? The manual steps are error-prone.

Tyler: What are you thinking?

Derek: Automated CI/CD pipeline. Would save time and reduce mistakes.

Tyler: I agree that's important. Derek, can you research options and estimate the effort?

Derek: Sure, I'll put together a proposal.

Tyler: When can you have that?

Derek: I'll need about a week. Let's say by November 25th.

Tyler: Perfect. Amy, can you document these action items and share with the team?

Amy: Will do.

Tyler: One last thing - let's celebrate our wins more. We shipped some great features this sprint.

Amy: Should we do team lunches when we hit major milestones?

Tyler: I like that. Let's make it a regular thing.

Derek: Count me in.

Tyler: Great retro everyone. Let's take these learnings into the next sprint.

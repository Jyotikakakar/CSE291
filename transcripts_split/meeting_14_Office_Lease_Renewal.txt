Title: Office Lease Renewal
Date: 2025-11-13
Duration: short

TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Patricia: Our office lease is up for renewal in February. We need to make a decision.

Kevin: Are we happy with this space?

Patricia: It's been fine, but we've outgrown it. We're at capacity.

Kevin: What are our options?

Patricia: We could negotiate to expand into the adjacent suite, or look for a new space entirely.

Kevin: What's your recommendation?

Patricia: The adjacent suite would be ideal. Same building, less disruption, and the landlord is willing to combine them.

Kevin: What about cost?

Patricia: They're asking for a 12% increase, but I think we can negotiate that down.

Kevin: Can you set up a meeting with the landlord to discuss terms?

Patricia: I'll arrange that for next week.

Kevin: And let's get a proposal in writing so we can review it carefully.

Patricia: Will do.

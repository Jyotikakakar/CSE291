Karen: Welcome everyone. We're bringing on three new engineers next month and need to ensure onboarding goes smoothly.

James: What's the timeline?

Karen: They start on November 11th. First one is Monday, other two on Wednesday.

James: Okay, we need to get their equipment ordered ASAP.

Karen: Right. James, can you handle the laptop orders and make sure they're configured?

James: Yes, I'll place the orders today to ensure they arrive in time.

Sarah: What about their accounts and access?

Karen: Good question. Sarah, can you work with IT to set up all their accounts by November 8th?

Sarah: Absolutely. I'll need their personal details and which systems they need access to.

Karen: I'll send that over by tomorrow. We also need to assign mentors to each of them.

James: I can take one of them. I think Mike and Jennifer would be good for the other two.

Karen: Perfect. Can you reach out to them and confirm they're available for the mentorship?

James: Will do.

Karen: We should also schedule a team lunch for their first Friday to help them feel welcome.

Sarah: I'll look into restaurant options and send around some choices.

Karen: Great. Let's make this a smooth process for them.

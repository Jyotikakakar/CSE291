Duration: medium

TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Angela: We need to ensure we're fully compliant with the new data privacy regulations that take effect January 1st.

Ryan: What are the key requirements?

Angela: The main ones are: explicit consent for data collection, right to deletion, and data portability.

Ryan: Where do we stand on those?

Angela: We're okay on explicit consent - our signup flow already covers that. But we need to implement mechanisms for deletion and portability.

Michelle: What's involved in implementing those?

Angela: For deletion, users need to be able to request removal of their data through their account settings. For portability, they need to be able to download all their data in a standard format.

Ryan: How long will that take to build?

Michelle: The deletion feature is straightforward - maybe two weeks. Data portability is more complex, probably a month.

Angela: We can't miss the January 1st deadline. Non-compliance could result in significant fines.

Ryan: Understood. Michelle, can you prioritize this work and get it into the sprint?

Michelle: Yes, I'll adjust our roadmap to accommodate it.

Angela: We also need to update our privacy policy to reflect these new capabilities.

Ryan: Angela, can you work with legal on that?

Angela: Already planning to. I'll have a draft by next Friday.

Ryan: We should also train our support team on how to handle these requests.

Michelle: Good point. Once the features are built, I'll create documentation for the support team.

Angela: Let's do a compliance check in early December to make sure everything is in place.

Ryan: I'll put that on the calendar. Thanks for staying on top of this, Angela.

**Tom:** Hey David, real quick. You know about the competitive analysis we're creating Wednesday morning?
**David:** No, what's that?
**Tom:** Jack, Marcus, and I are putting together a competitive analysis for the Q4 strategy. Should be done by Wednesday afternoon. I thought you might want to be in that meeting since strategy is kind of your thing?
**David:** Oh, I would. But let me check my calendar. Wednesday 9:00 to 11:00 AM? I have a conflict then.
**Tom:** Ah man. Can you move it?
**David:** Actually, I could do Wednesday 2:00 PM? I could join late or we could do a follow-up sync?
**Tom:** Let me check with Jack and Marcus. But yeah, we might be able to do a quick debrief with you Wednesday afternoon instead.
**David:** That would be great. Let me know.

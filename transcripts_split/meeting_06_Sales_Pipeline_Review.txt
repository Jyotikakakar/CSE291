Greg: Let's quickly review where we are with the pipeline.

Amanda: We have 23 qualified leads in the pipeline, total value of $890K.

Greg: How many are close to closing?

Amanda: Five are in final negotiations. I'm confident we'll close three of them this month.

Greg: What about the other two?

Amanda: They're asking for custom pricing. I need to involve finance to structure those deals.

Greg: Okay, let's get finance on a call with you tomorrow to work through it.

Amanda: I'll set that up.

Greg: What do you need from me?

Amanda: If you could join the call with Zenith Industries on Thursday, that would help. They want to speak with leadership.

Greg: Done. Send me the details.

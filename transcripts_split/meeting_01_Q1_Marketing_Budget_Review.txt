Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's quickly review the Q1 marketing budget.

Mike: We're tracking at 87% of our allocated spend for digital ads.

Sarah: That's good. What about the influencer partnerships?

Jen: We've reached out to five influencers. Three have responded positively. I think we should finalize those contracts by end of week.

Sarah: Perfect. Mike, can you pull together a detailed breakdown of the digital ad performance?

Mike: Sure, I'll have that ready by Wednesday.

Sarah: Great. Jen, once those contracts are signed, we'll need to schedule the kickoff calls with each influencer.

Jen: I'll coordinate that. Should be able to get them on the calendar for early November.

Sarah: Excellent. That's all for today.

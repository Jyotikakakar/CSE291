**Context:** References resource allocation meeting earlier today, John's involvement in market report.

**Jill:** Hey John, how'd the market report kickoff go?
**John:** Really well. Jack, Marcus, Tom, and I aligned on scope. Three-week timeline.
**Jill:** Nice. So that's on top of everything else?
**John:** Yeah, but it's got dedicated time. We're meeting next Thursday to check progress.
**Jill:** Good. Hey, totally different topic—how did your resource allocation meeting go?
**Jill:** Actually, it just wrapped. Sarah, Marcus, and I got through all the data. We're putting together the presentation tomorrow.
**Marcus:** Yeah, the three-year trend was really insightful. Shows exactly where we need to invest.
**Sarah:** And the budget allocations tell a story too. We can show leadership where money is actually going versus where it should go.
**John:** That's useful. When does Rebecca see it?
**Jill:** End of this week. So we've got market report kicking off, resource analysis due Friday, and... I feel like there's more?
**John:** There's always more. But at least things are organized.
**Jill:** True. Let's keep moving.

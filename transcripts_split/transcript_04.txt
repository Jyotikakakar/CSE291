## Transcript 4: LONG - Friday 2:00 PM

**Context:** Extended conversation reviewing entire week's schedule with references to all prior meetings and decisions.

**Jack:** Jill, I wanted to walk through next week with you. We've scheduled a lot and I want to make sure there are no real conflicts.
**Jill:** Okay, what are you seeing?
**Jack:** Remember Tuesday morning when I quickly asked about the vendor review at 9:00 AM?
**Jill:** Tuesday 9:00 to 10:00 AM, yes.
**Jack:** Then Thursday in the hallway you asked about the client proposal at 10:30 to 11:30 AM. And yesterday we added Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM for vendor follow-up.
**Jill:** Right. Three vendor sessions.
**Jack:** Well, after reviewing the files this morning, I realize Tuesday's one hour isn't enough. We need two hours. Can you do Tuesday 9:00 to 11:00 AM instead?
**Jill:** Tuesday is open after 10:00, so yes, I can do 9:00 to 11:00 AM.
**Jack:** Good. So: Tuesday 9:00 to 11:00 AM initial vendor review, Wednesday 2:00 to 4:00 PM detailed analysis, Thursday 10:30 to 11:30 AM client proposal, Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM vendor follow-up.
**Jill:** That's four hours of vendor work spread across three days plus the proposal. It's intense but doable.
**Jack:** I know. But breaking it up helps you absorb everything. I'll send Sunday evening notes, Monday files arrive, I do Saturday morning prep. That's the flow.
**Jill:** What about Monday?
**Jack:** You gather files Monday. I review Saturday and Sunday. We're ready Tuesday.
**Jill:** Okay, I can work with that. Tuesday 9-11 AM, Wednesday 2-4 PM, Thursday 10:30-11:30 AM and 2-3:30 PM.
**Jack:** Perfect. This feels organized now.
**Jill:** Yeah, it does. Thanks for planning it out.

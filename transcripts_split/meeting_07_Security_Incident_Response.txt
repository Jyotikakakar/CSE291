TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Marcus: We detected unusual login attempts this morning from multiple IP addresses.

Kevin: How many attempts are we talking about?

Marcus: Over 500 in a two-hour window. Clear brute force pattern.

Kevin: Were any successful?

Marcus: No, our rate limiting kicked in. But we need to take additional measures.

Sophie: What's the plan?

Marcus: First, we should force password resets for any accounts that were targeted.

Kevin: How many accounts?

Marcus: About 47.

Kevin: Okay. Marcus, can you prepare the communication to those users explaining what happened?

Marcus: Yes, I'll draft that and run it by legal before sending.

Sophie: Should we implement additional security measures?

Marcus: Definitely. I recommend we enable two-factor authentication as mandatory for all users.

Kevin: That's a big change. What's the rollout plan?

Marcus: We could do a phased approach. Start with admin accounts, then roll out to all users over two weeks.

Kevin: Makes sense. Sophie, can you coordinate the user communication and training for 2FA?

Sophie: Sure. I'll create some help documentation and video tutorials.

Kevin: We also need to report this to the board. Marcus, can you prepare an incident summary?

Marcus: I'll have that ready by end of day.

Kevin: Let's also review our security policies. Sophie, can you schedule a comprehensive security audit?

Sophie: Absolutely. I'll find a reputable firm and get quotes.

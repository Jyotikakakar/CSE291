TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Rebecca: It's time to start planning our year-end performance reviews.

Josh: What's the timeline?

Rebecca: We need to complete all reviews by December 20th so we can process compensation changes for January 1st.

Josh: That's coming up fast.

Rebecca: I know. Let's work backwards. Managers need to submit their reviews to HR by December 13th for processing.

Tanya: That means managers need to complete their reviews in early December.

Rebecca: Exactly. But before that, we need to do the self-assessment phase.

Josh: When should employees complete self-assessments?

Rebecca: Let's give them two weeks. If we launch the process on November 11th, self-assessments would be due November 25th.

Tanya: That works. What about the review template? Are we using the same one as last year?

Rebecca: I'd like to update it. The feedback we got last year was that it was too focused on ratings and not enough on development.

Josh: What changes are you thinking?

Rebecca: More open-ended questions about growth, career aspirations, and specific examples of impact.

Tanya: I like that approach. It feels more meaningful.

Rebecca: Josh, can you work with me to revise the template?

Josh: Absolutely. Should we get input from some managers first?

Rebecca: Good idea. Can you schedule focus groups with 5-6 managers?

Josh: Sure, I'll set those up for next week.

Rebecca: Once we have the template finalized, we'll need to train all managers on how to use it.

Tanya: Should we do that as a group session or individual training?

Rebecca: I think a group session would be more efficient. We can do a 90-minute workshop.

Tanya: I'll book a conference room for early November. How about November 8th?

Rebecca: Let me check... yes, that works. Tanya, can you send out the calendar invite?

Tanya: Will do.

Rebecca: We should also prepare supporting materials - a manager's guide to giving effective feedback.

Josh: I can work on that. Should include examples of good and bad feedback.

Rebecca: Perfect. We'll need that ready before the training session.

Josh: I'll have a draft ready by November 5th for your review.

Rebecca: Great. One more thing - we need to communicate the timeline to all employees.

Tanya: I'll draft an email announcement. Should go out right after the manager training.

Rebecca: Yes, and let's include an FAQ document to address common questions.

Tanya: Good thinking. I'll work on that too.

Rebecca: This is going to be our best review cycle yet. Thanks everyone for the collaboration.

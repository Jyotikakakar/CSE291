## Transcript 7: LONG - Tuesday 10:00 AM

**Characters:** Jill, John, Sarah  
**Context:** References Monday's request, introduces task conflict.

**Sarah:** Okay, so I pulled the data like you asked. Here's the analytics dashboard export.
**Jill:** Perfect, thank you. So John and I are going to work on the quarterly performance report. We've got it blocked for this afternoon.
**John:** Actually, Jill, I wanted to talk about that. I know you asked me to help with the performance report, but I was also thinking—we could create a comprehensive market report instead. That would be more useful for leadership.
**Jill:** A market report? That's different from what we discussed.
**John:** I know, but hear me out. The performance data is just internal. A market report would show where we stand against competitors and give us strategic direction.
**Jill:** Hmm. I see your point, but the quarterly performance report is what was requested by Rebecca. She specifically asked for it.
**John:** Right, but if we pitch the market report to her first, she might prefer it.
**Jill:** Okay, here's what I think. Let's do both, but sequentially. We finish the performance report this week, and next week we can start the market report. Sound fair?
**John:** Actually, that works. I can wait until next week. The market report is lower priority anyway.
**Jill:** Great. So we're still doing the performance report this afternoon?
**John:** Yeah, let's do it. What time?
**Jill:** 2:00 to 4:00 PM okay?
**John:** Perfect.

-----------

Alex: Thanks for joining. We need to nail down the product roadmap for the next quarter.

David: I've been analyzing user feedback. The top request is definitely the dark mode feature.

Alex: Interesting. What's the level of effort on that?

David: Engineering estimates about three weeks if we prioritize it.

Lisa: We should also consider the API integration that the enterprise clients have been asking for.

Alex: Good point. How critical is that?

Lisa: Very. We have two major clients who said they'd increase their contracts by 40% if we deliver it by end of year.

David: That's significant revenue impact.

Alex: Okay, so we're looking at dark mode and API integration as top priorities. David, can you work with engineering to create detailed specs for both?

David: Absolutely. I'll need to meet with the engineering leads to scope this properly.

Alex: Lisa, can you document the exact requirements from those enterprise clients?

Lisa: Yes, I'll reach out to them this week and compile everything.

Alex: Perfect. Let's reconvene in two weeks to review the specs and timeline. David, can you send out a meeting invite?

David: Will do.

Alex: Also, we should loop in the design team early on the dark mode work. Lisa, can you set up a sync with them?

Lisa: Sure thing. I'll get that on the calendar for next Monday.

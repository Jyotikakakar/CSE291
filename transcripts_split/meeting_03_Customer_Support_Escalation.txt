TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Tom: We've got a situation with the Acme Corp account.

Rachel: What's happening?

Tom: They're experiencing intermittent outages. Started yesterday morning.

Rachel: Have we identified the cause?

Tom: Engineering is investigating. Looks like it might be related to the database migration last week.

Rachel: This is a priority account. Tom, can you provide hourly updates to the client until it's resolved?

Tom: Yes, I'll set up a communication schedule with them.

Rachel: Good. I'll need a full incident report once this is resolved.

Tom: I'll document everything and have that ready.

Rachel: Let's also schedule a post-mortem with engineering for Friday to make sure this doesn't happen again.

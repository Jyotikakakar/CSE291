**Characters:** Sarah, Marcus, Jill  
**Context:** References Tuesday report completion, introduces new task.

**Sarah:** Hey Jill, I saw you finished the quarterly performance report. Great work.
**Jill:** Thanks! John really helped with that. But now I need to do the department resource allocation analysis.
**Marcus:** Oh, you're doing that now?
**Jill:** Yeah, it's due next week. Sarah, I was going to ask you—can you help me gather the headcount data?
**Sarah:** I can help. But Marcus, aren't you also doing a resource analysis? For the engineering team?
**Marcus:** Yeah, but that's just for engineering. Jill's sounds like it's company-wide?
**Jill:** It is. So Sarah, can you gather company-wide headcount? And Marcus, can you pull the engineering-specific detail?
**Marcus:** Sure, I can do that.
**Sarah:** Yeah, I'll compile the overall numbers.
**Jill:** Great. Let's meet Monday afternoon to combine everything.

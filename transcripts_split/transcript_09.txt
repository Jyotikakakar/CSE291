## Transcript 9: LONG - Wednesday 1:00 PM

**Characters:** Jack, Marcus, Tom, David  
**Context:** References competitive analysis from Transcript 6, David's conflict from Transcript 8, and upcoming debrief.

**Jack:** Okay, so we wrapped up the competitive analysis this morning. Good work, everyone.
**Marcus:** Yeah, I think we nailed the market positioning section.
**Tom:** Definitely. David, sorry you couldn't make the morning session. We had a scheduling conflict.
**David:** No worries. I know you guys were locked in at 9:00 to 11:00. I had another commitment. But Tom said you wanted to do a quick debrief? I'm free now.
**Jack:** Actually, yes. We were thinking 2:00 PM? That gives us time to compile everything. Just a 30-minute sync to walk you through what we found?
**David:** 2:00 PM works. So the full competitive analysis is done this morning, and I get a briefing at 2:00 this afternoon?
**Marcus:** Exactly. You'll be all caught up.
**Tom:** Perfect.

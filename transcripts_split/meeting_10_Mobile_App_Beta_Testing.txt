TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Chris: Our mobile app beta is ready to go. We need to finalize the testing plan.

Laura: How many beta testers are we aiming for?

Chris: I'd like to start with 100 users - mix of iOS and Android.

Laura: Do we have a list of potential testers?

Chris: Marketing has a list of engaged users who opted in for early access.

Laura: Perfect. What's the testing period?

Chris: Two weeks should give us enough feedback. We'll launch the beta on November 12th.

Dan: What are we asking testers to focus on?

Chris: Core functionality first - login, navigation, main features. Then we want feedback on UI and overall experience.

Laura: Should we create a structured feedback form?

Chris: Definitely. Dan, can you create a survey that covers all the key areas?

Dan: Sure. I'll include both ratings and open-ended questions.

Chris: We should also set up a way for testers to report bugs directly in the app.

Dan: We can integrate a feedback widget. I'll get that implemented this week.

Chris: Great. Laura, can you work with marketing to send out the beta invitations?

Laura: Yes. Should we include instructions on how to install the beta?

Chris: Absolutely. We'll need separate instructions for iOS and Android.

Laura: I'll draft those and have them ready by Monday.

Chris: We should also plan a midpoint check-in with testers to address any issues early.

Dan: Good idea. Maybe a group video call where they can share feedback?

Chris: Yes, let's schedule that for November 19th. Laura, can you coordinate?

Laura: I'll set it up.

Chris: After the beta closes, we'll need to analyze all the feedback and prioritize fixes.

Dan: I'll create a system for categorizing and tracking all the feedback.

Chris: Excellent. This is going to really help us polish the app before public launch.

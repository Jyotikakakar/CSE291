## Transcript 3: LONG - Friday 10:00 AM

**Context:** Extended interaction referencing multiple earlier conversations and scheduling decisions.

**Jack:** Hey, thanks for taking this. I want to revisit our schedule. Remember Tuesday when I asked about the vendor review at 9:00 AM?
**Jill:** Yeah, Tuesday 9:00 to 10:00 AM. And then Thursday evening you asked about the client proposal walkthrough at 10:30 to 11:30 AM?
**Jack:** Right. And yesterday we scheduled Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM for the vendor follow-up. Now I've realized we need more time. The scope is bigger than I thought.
**Jill:** What do you mean?
**Jack:** We need a mid-week session. What if we do Wednesday afternoon? 2:00 to 4:00 PM for detailed analysis?
**Jill:** Wednesday is open. So we'd have: Tuesday 9:00 to 10:00 AM initial review, Wednesday 2:00 to 4:00 PM deep dive, Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM follow-up?
**Jack:** Exactly. Three sessions instead of two gives us better flow. I'll review the files Monday night and send you preliminary notes Sunday evening.
**Jill:** That helps me prepare. Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon. I can manage that.
**Jack:** I know it's packed, but it'll produce better results. Alright, I'll send the Wednesday invite.
**Jill:** Sounds good. Thanks for thinking this through.

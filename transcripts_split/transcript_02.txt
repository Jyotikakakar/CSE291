## Transcript 2: MEDIUM - Thursday 5:30 PM

**Context:** Short dialogue referencing earlier conversation (Transcript 1 - Tuesday 9-10 AM meeting).

**Jack:** Hey, thanks for sticking around. So remember this morning when we scheduled the vendor contract review for Tuesday at 9:00 AM?
**Jill:** Yeah, the Tuesday morning slot.
**Jack:** Right. I realized we should prep before that meeting. Can you pull the procurement files by Monday end of day? I'll do a preliminary review over the weekend.
**Jill:** Sure, I can gather them Monday. Should we add a follow-up session after Tuesday?
**Jack:** Good idea. How about Thursday afternoon? Say 2:00 to 3:30 PM?
**Jill:** Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM works. I'll have time to think about what we found Tuesday.
**Jack:** Perfect. So Tuesday 9:00 to 10:00 AM initial review, Thursday 2:00 to 3:30 PM follow-up. Files by Monday.
**Jill:** Got it. I'll have them ready.

-----------

Nina: We should plan something fun for the team before the holidays get too busy.

Paul: What are you thinking?

Nina: Maybe a team outing? Bowling, escape room, something interactive.

Paul: I like the escape room idea. When should we do this?

Nina: How about the third week of November? Maybe Thursday the 20th?

Paul: Works for me. Nina, can you research escape room options and get pricing?

Nina: Sure, I'll check out a few places and report back.

Paul: We should also think about budget for dinner afterwards.

Nina: Good idea. I'll include restaurant options too.

Paul: Perfect. Let's touch base early next week once you have the details.

TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Jessica: I had an interesting conversation with the folks at TechFlow Solutions.

Mark: What about?

Jessica: They're interested in a partnership. They'd integrate our platform into their product suite.

Mark: That could be huge for distribution. What are they proposing?

Jessica: A revenue share arrangement. They'd promote our solution to their 50,000 customers.

Mark: What do they want in return?

Jessica: 20% of revenue from customers they refer, plus some co-marketing efforts.

Mark: The revenue share seems reasonable. What's the next step?

Jessica: They want to schedule a formal presentation with our leadership team.

Mark: Let's set that up. Can you coordinate with their team?

Jessica: I'll reach out today and find a time that works for everyone.

Mark: Also, can you put together a brief analysis of the opportunity - potential reach, revenue projections?

Jessica: Absolutely, I'll have that ready before the meeting.

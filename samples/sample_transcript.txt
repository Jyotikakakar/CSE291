Alice: Let's start the Q4 planning meeting. We need to prioritize features.

Bob: I think we should focus on the mobile app. Users have been requesting it.

Alice: Good point. Bob, can you lead the mobile app project?

Bob: Yes, I'll create a spec by next Friday.

Carol: We also need to implement SSO for enterprise customers.

Alice: That's critical. Carol, you own SSO. Target is November 30th.

Carol: Got it. I'll need David's help on backend.

David: Happy to help. I see a risk though - our auth service is outdated.

Alice: Let's address that. David, audit the auth service this week.

Speaker A: Welcome to our roadmap planning. Let's review customer feedback.

Speaker B: We surveyed 45 enterprise customers. Top requests: SSO, analytics, mobile support.

Speaker C: 78% of enterprise customers want SSO. It's blocking deals.

Speaker A: Clear priority. SSO first. What's the effort?

Speaker D: 6 weeks with two engineers for SAML and OAuth.

Speaker A: Approved. Speaker B, you're product lead. Speaker D, technical lead.

Speaker B: I'll have the spec ready next Friday.

Speaker D: I'll need Speaker E and Speaker F on this.

Speaker A: Make it happen. What about analytics?

Speaker C: Complex feature. I recommend phased approach - basic reporting in Q4, advanced in Q1.

Speaker B: That makes sense. Ship basic first, learn, then iterate.

Speaker A: Good. Speaker C, present three options at next week's meeting.

Speaker C: Will do.

Speaker A: Mobile support?

Speaker D: Native app is expensive. Let's improve mobile web in Q4, defer native to Q1.

Speaker A: Agreed. Speaker F, estimate effort for mobile web improvements.

Speaker F: About 3 weeks. I can handle it.

Speaker A: Perfect. So Q4 priorities: SSO, basic analytics, mobile web. Any risks?

Speaker C: Team might be stretched too thin with only 4 engineers.

Speaker D: If SSO hits blockers, other projects slip.

Speaker A: Valid. Let's add 2-week buffer for SSO. Speaker B, create detailed project plan by Monday.

Speaker B: On it.

Speaker A: Design review meeting. Speaker B, walk us through your proposal.

Speaker B: I designed a new navigation system. Three main improvements: clearer hierarchy, better mobile responsiveness, and faster load times.

Speaker C: I like the hierarchy. Why did you choose a sidebar over a top nav?

Speaker B: User research showed 73% prefer sidebar for complex applications. It's also better for accessibility.

Speaker D: What about mobile? Sidebar can be problematic on small screens.

Speaker B: Good point. On mobile, it collapses to a hamburger menu. I have prototypes.

Speaker A: Show us the alternatives you considered.

Speaker B: I considered three approaches: traditional top nav, sidebar, and a hybrid. Top nav limited our scalability. Hybrid was confusing in testing. Sidebar performed best.

Speaker C: What's the implementation effort?

Speaker D: About 2 weeks for front-end work. We'd need to refactor some routing.

Speaker A: Any risks?

Speaker D: Main risk is breaking existing functionality. We need comprehensive testing.

Speaker B: I've documented all edge cases. We can do phased rollout to mitigate risk.

Speaker A: Good thinking. Let's move forward. Speaker D, you own implementation. Target completion is November 15th.

Speaker D: Got it.

Speaker A: Speaker C, work with Speaker B on user testing plan.

Speaker C: Will do. I'll have a plan by Thursday.

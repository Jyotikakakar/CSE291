Speaker A: Let's do our sprint retrospective. What went well?

Speaker B: We completed all our story points. The new CI pipeline helped a lot.

Speaker C: Code quality improved. We caught several bugs before production.

Speaker A: Excellent. What could be improved?

Speaker B: Code reviews are taking too long. Some PRs sat for 3 days.

Speaker C: We should set a 24-hour review target.

Speaker A: Good idea. Speaker C, document this in our team handbook by end of week.

Speaker C: Will do.

Speaker A: Any blockers for next sprint?

Speaker B: We need API keys from the vendor. Speaker A, can you follow up?

Speaker A: Yes, I'll email them today.

Speaker C: Also, we need to upgrade our database. It's a risk for performance.

Speaker A: Good point. Speaker C, create a proposal for the database upgrade by Monday.

Speaker C: On it.

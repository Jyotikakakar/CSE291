# Tech Team Meeting Transcripts

## Meeting 1: Sprint Planning
Date: November 1, 2024

Alice: Good morning team. Let's plan our sprint for the mobile app backend.

Bob: I think we should focus on the API authentication layer first. We're getting security audit feedback.

Carol: Agree. The OAuth implementation needs work. I can lead that effort.

Alice: Perfect. Carol owns OAuth. Target is two weeks. Bob, what about the database schema?

Bob: I've designed the schema for user profiles and sessions. Ready to implement. Should take one week.

David: We also need to set up Redis for caching. Performance tests show we need it for scale.

Alice: Good point. David, you own Redis integration. One week timeline.

Carol: One risk - the OAuth provider API has been flaky. We might need a backup plan.

Alice: Let's schedule a checkpoint on Wednesday to assess OAuth progress. Any blockers?

Bob: We need staging environment access. DevOps hasn't provisioned it yet.

Alice: I'll follow up with DevOps today. Let's move forward. Sprint goal: OAuth, database schema, and Redis caching.

## Meeting 2: Mid-Sprint Standup
Date: November 8, 2024

Alice: Quick standup. Carol, OAuth status?

Carol: OAuth integration is 70% done. The provider API issues we worried about haven't appeared yet. Should finish by tomorrow.

Alice: Excellent news. Bob, database?

Bob: Database schema is deployed to staging. Running migration scripts now. Found one issue with foreign key constraints that I'm fixing.

Alice: Timeline impact?

Bob: Minimal. Still on track for end of week.

David: Redis is integrated and tested. Cache hit rate is 85% in local testing. Ready to deploy to staging.

Alice: Great progress team. Carol, once OAuth is done, can you help Bob with the constraint issue?

Carol: Yes, I'll pair with him tomorrow afternoon.

Alice: Perfect. One concern - we haven't load tested yet. David, can you set up load tests for Monday?

David: On it. I'll use k6 for load testing.

## Meeting 3: Sprint Retrospective
Date: November 15, 2024

Alice: Sprint retro time. What went well?

Bob: We hit all our targets. OAuth is live, database schema is solid, Redis is performing great.

Carol: Collaboration was excellent. Pairing with Bob on the constraint issue saved us a day.

David: Load tests showed impressive results. We can handle 10K concurrent users with current setup.

Alice: Outstanding work. What could be improved?

Carol: We should have involved QA earlier. We caught some edge cases late in the sprint.

Bob: Agreed. Also, documentation was rushed at the end. We should document as we code.

Alice: Good points. Next sprint, let's have QA shadow us from day one. And let's adopt docs-as-code practice.

David: One more thing - we need better monitoring. I want to set up Datadog.

Alice: Add that to next sprint backlog. Overall, great sprint team. Let's take this momentum forward.
